# Example configuration for docling-jobkit-multiproc
# This demonstrates parallel batch processing with local path sources and target

options:
  do_ocr: false
  # Uncomment to enable additional features:
  # do_table_structure: true
  # to_formats:
  #   - json
  #   - md

sources:
  # Example 1: Process all files in a folder recursively
  - kind: local_path
    path: ./input_documents/
    recursive: true  # this is also the default
  
  # Example 2: Process a single file (uncomment and adjust path as needed)
  # - kind: local_path
  #   path: ./input_documents/2206.00785.pdf
  #   # pattern and recursive are ignored for single files
    
  # Example 3: Process multiple file types with glob pattern (uncomment to use)
  # - kind: local_path
  #   path: ./input_documents/
  #   pattern: "*.{pdf,docx,pptx}"
  #   recursive: true
